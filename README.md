Belief Revision Agent for 02180 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

To run the code on the command terminal:
navigate to the folder containing main.py and type

python3 main.py

Instructions on how to use the belief revision agent (including command formats) will appear when the program is run.

Note that the belief revision agent works but might take a long time to produce results when too many statements are added to it (greater than 4 or 5).

There is currently no functionality for directly removing a statement from the belief base.
